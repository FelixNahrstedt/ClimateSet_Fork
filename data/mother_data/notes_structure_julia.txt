# Notes Julia (general)
# Raw-preprocesser: every file, no matter if cmip6 or input4mips (if applicable)
# CMIP6-preprocesser: preprocesses cmip6
# Input4MIPs preprocesser: preprocesses input4mips
# preprocesser ("complete preprocesser"): runs input4mips and cmip6s preprocesser
    # this is used directly after the downloader
    # checks for corrupted files etc.
    # checks the desired params (user input / stored in data params) and starts the other two preprocessers accordingly
    # checks the outcome (same units? same resolutions (time & space))
    # prints a description of the resulting dataset for the user
    # done, dataloader can be used afterwards


# Documentation:
# settle on one way to create docs (Google docstring type is the closest to what we use rn?)
# Args / Kwargs / Returns / Raises

# GHG Lifetimes: https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ar4-wg1-chapter2-1.pdf#table-2-14
  # CO2: Cumulative nature!!! difficult. very long-time. 50% of CO2 increase will be removed within 30 years, 30% within a few centuries. The other 20% may stay for many thousands of years.

  # CH4: 12 years
  # NOx: 114 years
  # SO2: 1.56 days
  # BC:  days - weeks

# What needs to be aggregated:
# Future scenarios:
  # anthro + openburning + AIR-anthro
# Historic scenarios:
  # anthro + openburning + AIR-anthro
  # --> problem: there are no openburning files from Steven Smith. should we use this one here:
  # input4MIPs.CMIP6.CMIP.VUA.VUA-CMIP-BB4CMIP6-1-2.atmos.mon.BC.gn
  # ask Steven about that! 25km nominal resolution, but same unit as the other files!

Archive Code:
if "historical_BC_em_biomassburning" in file:
    actual_res = ds.nominal_resolution.split(' ')
    new_parts = file.split('_')[0:5]+ actual_res[0:2] + file.split('_')[7:10]
    old_name = root + '/' + file
    new_name = root + '/' + '_'.join(new_parts)
    os.rename(old_name, new_name)
