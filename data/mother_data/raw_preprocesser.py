# mother preprocesser: only used once (by us), never used by user, basic preprocessing steps

# preprocesses high-resolution data

    # three cases:
        # input external var
        # input model internal var
        # output model

# holt sich daten von RAW und steckt sie in PREPROCESSED

# TODO: unit check

# class
# params:
# data_source: which data should be raw_processed
# data_store: where the cleaned up and structured data is put (PROCESSED)
# LATER: add further raw_processing params from mother_params if that should become necessary

# functions:

# clean_up() data such that data is in the finest resolution and raedy for res_preprocesser

# structure() data in PREPROCESSED (clear names, structure, etc)
