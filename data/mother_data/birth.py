# init file to establish first data basis

# interacts with:
# mother_params,
# inits and executes downloader --> stored in raw
# preprocesses downloaded data [raw_preprocesser] --> stored in preprocessed
# first resolution processing [rew_preprocesser] --> stored in load

# no classes, just script

# ATTENTION
# during aggregation: take care of units and how they change (should be handled within raw_preprocesser)
