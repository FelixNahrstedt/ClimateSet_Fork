General flags:
[A] : Average
[I] : Instantaneous
[X] : Maximum
[M] : Minimum

Depending on the (sub)model, the frequencies can be chosen quite differently,
even considering 50-year frequencies, e.g. in CLM5: hist_mfilt = 50

table_id is decoding which temporal grid should be used for the output of the model.
It's different for different types of variables.

'fx'      : Fixed variables
'day'     : Daily data (extension: contains both atmospheric and oceanographic data)
'SImon'   : Monthly sea-ice data
'SIday'   : Daily sea-ice data
'Oyr'     : Annual ocean variables (mean)
'Omon'    : Monthly ocean variables
'Ofx'     : Fixed ocean variables
'Oday'    : Daily ocean variables
'Lmon'    : Monthly land surface and soil model fields
'LImon'   : Monthly fields for the terrestrial cryosphere
'Emon'    : Monthly, time mean, extension
'Eday'    : Daily, time mean, extension
'CFmon'   : Monthly data associated with cloud forcing
'CFday'   : Daily data associated with cloud forcing
'CF3hr'   : 3-hourly data associated with cloud forcing
'Amon'    : Monthly atmospheric data
'AERmon'  : Monthly atmospheric chemistry and aerosol data (same for AERmonZ - zonal mean though)
'AERfx'   : Fixed atmospheric chemistry and aerosol data
'AERhr'   : Hourly atmospheric chemistry and aerosol data
'AERday'  : Daily atmospheric chemistry and aerosol data
'6hrPlevPt': 6-hourly data on pressure levels (instantaneous mean)
'6hrPlev' : 6-hourly data on pressure levels (time mean)
'6hrLev'  : 6-hourly data on atmospheric model levels
'3hr'     : Atmosphere sampled every three hours

Open question: Can all variables be found in the extension frequencies "E"?
